Visualizing Administrative Data with Tableau

Midwest Big Data Hub, May 25-26, 2019

ABSTRACT: This seminar is designed to introduce participants to Tableau, one of many applications that facilitate exploratory and 
descriptive analysis (EDA) of quantitative data. Our approach will be to learn through doing: We will use the Behavioral Risk Factors 
Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health surveillance system of the Centers for Disease Control, to become familiar with Tableauâ€™s data 
visualization capabilities. While our applied focus will be to use Tableau to explore the BRFSS data, participants will also learn a 
number of foundational principles of data visualization, including considerations in the choice of colors, the matching of visualizations 
to measurement scales, institutional branding in visualization design, an introduction to the cognitive aspects of data visualization, 
and some ethics and best practices in the visual presentation of data. Participants will be provided with several working examples, and 
we will use our time in class to replicate and innovate on these examples. The broader goal of this workshop is to provide an introductory 
framework for how Tableau can be used for EDA of public, administrative data, especially in the context of individual-level, complex 
survey data.

PRERQUISITES: It is not necessary for participants to be familiar with either the BRFSS data or with Tableau prior to attending the 
workshop. We will assume participants have little to no prior experience with Tableau or with the visualization of quantitative data. 
For those working in areas outside of public health, you are welcome and encouraged to bring your own dataset(s) to the workshop. 
The design of the workshop is such that you should be able to following along and build vizzies using your own data without falling 
behind your classmates. 

THINGS TO DO BEFORE THE WORKSHOP. Download and install Tableau Desktop to your laptop. If you are a student, you can get a free, 
full version of the software here (https://www.tableau.com/academic/students). If you are not a student, you can get a 15 day trial 
version here (https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/trial), but be sure to hold off on getting your trial version until you are within 
a week or so of the workshop. You should also skim through the Tableau Gallery to get a sense of what you can do with Tableau and, while 
viewing, find at least one Tableau workbook to download. You want to do this so that you can test your personal software install and 
make sure it is working and functional for the workshop. For those wishing to glean a little background information on the BRFSS 
datasets, see here (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm). We will use the 2017 BRFSS dataset throughout the workshop.
